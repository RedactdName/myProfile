                <p className="about-me-info">After graduating from the University of Colorado at Boulder, I spent 8 years working in the healthcare sector. Across the varied roles I took on I gained skills in administration, sales, customer service, and management. After moving to a remote and then hybrid role I made the decision that I would not let my technical know how fall behind current trends and acqumen requirments to keep up with the workforce and life. When a company restructuring found me seeking new employment I decided to kick these new desires into high gear and enrolled in a bootcamp for full stack web development with The University of Denver.
